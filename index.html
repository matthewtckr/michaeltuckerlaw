                <p>Medicaid Planning is an important issue that affects not only the elderly and infirm, but their children as well. Many seniors find that their previous planning is inadequate when it comes to Medicaid and long term care. Many thousands of dollars are lost to families each and every day because of inadequate planning or no planning at all.  It goes without saying that it&#8217;s never too early to plan ahead.</p>
